# Python-Web-Development-Assignment-3

In this assignment, we signed up MongoDB Atlas, installed MongoDB Community Edition, and ran queries in MongoDB Compass.

The first query instructions were: **Find all movies with runtime greater than 200 minutes in year 1983. The result should include a list of objects sorted by runtime increasing, and each object only has three fields: runtime, title, year. An example result is shown in the following screenshot.**

Here is my query and results:

The second query instructions were: **Find all movies after year 2014 with imdb rating greater than 9.**

Here is my query and results:
